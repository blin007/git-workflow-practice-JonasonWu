# Interesting Article on [Missed Expectations](https://knowledge.kitchen/mediawiki/images/c/ce/Crosstalk_-_Missed_Expectations.pdf)
======================

It was interesting that the article talks about what colleges do not teach students to prepare for industry. Some of the reasons why students are not really prepared for the CS industry is that they are lacking in experience with many softwares, unable to write good software tests, and inexperienced in working with big projects. I can relate to these problems because the college courses that I have taken hardly covers any of these aspects. Most of the courses just need basic java and/or python syntax and there was barely any review on frameworks and libraries that should be used.
